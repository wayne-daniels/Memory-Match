> For this version we will be breaking down the programmatic flow and explaining the decisions that the program has to make to fully understand how the user is interacting. As we move further into the program we will be showing less and less of the flow and expect a certain level of understanding of logical flow. The diagram below should help you follow along with the bullet points.

Memory match is a game with 18 cards face down and the player has to try and match all 10 pairs of matching cards by 
remembering the position of the cards. Once the player has matched 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all 
pairs have been matched.

## Versions

### Version 0.1 (v0.1)

# Memory Match - Version 0.1 (v0.1)


#### Overview

> This version is used to reinforce HTML, CSS & layout concepts to put your own flare into a classic game of 
concentration. The scope for this version asks the student to choose a theme for the game including: 

> - 9 card faces

- 1 card back
- Creating an about page describing about the game and the skills that went into creating it.

> This version will integrate with instructor built JavaScript to give the layout built by the student's functionality 
and show the ability of design & layout to be independent of functionality but strict requirements are needed 
(specific classes and id’s). In future versions the students will be building out the same functionality that is 
provided with each student providing their own flare and features. The students will pull the knowledge from what 
they have learned from the resources they have consumed and the prototypes they have completed and pull it into one 
cohesive version of this project.

## Functionality Overview
1. Memory match is a matching game in which a player attempts to match the images contained on "playing cards".
2. There are a total of 18 cards:
    - Each card contains 1 of 9 images
    - There are two of each image allowing for 9 total matches
3. The following stats are tracked:
    - Total number of games played
    - Total number of matches for the current game
    - The accuracy of the players attempts to match the cards in relation to the current game (as a percentage)
4. The cards are displayed face down and "flip" over when they are clicked.
5. Two cards can be flipped each round.
6. If the images of the two cards which are flipped over match:
    - The cards remain flipped over and the player gets 1 point for the match
    - 1 point is added to the total number of attempted matches.
    - The player's accuracy is updated
7. If the two flipped over cards do not match:
    - The cards are flipped back over
    - 1 is added to the total number of attempts
    - The players accuracy is updated
    - The player must choose two cards again to continue searching for a match.
8. After each turn, stats are displayed, including:
    - The total number of matches made
    - The accuracy calculated from the total number of matches and total number of attempts
9. Once all 9 cards have been matched:
    - A modal is shown to the player telling them they have won.
    - A button is provided which can reset the game by clicking on it.
10. Resetting the game performs the following actions:
    - All cards are flipped back over
    - The number of games played is increased
    - The total number of matches are reset
    - The accuracy percentage is reset to 0%
